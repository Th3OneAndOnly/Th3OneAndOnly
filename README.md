What's that? You're still here? I guess you want to know some stuff about me. Well, let's see...

* I am a self-taught programmer, started on Codecademy about 5 years ago. 📖
* Used to develop a lot in Python but never released anything on Github. 🐍
* I like to make music, which is another one of my hobbies. 🎵

Alright random fact time GO!!!

***MY LEFT KNEE IS SLIGHTER LARGER THAN MY RIGHT--*** phew! Glad to get that over with.

Also I have a github website: [th3oneandonly.github.io](https://th3oneandonly.github.io) *\*fancy\**!

### Now I must leave! The repos call me! 🦸‍♂️
